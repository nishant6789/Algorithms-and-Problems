# Algorithms-and-Problems
#### This repository consists of approach to different problems involving Data structures and Algorithms.
##### Anyone can contribute. Code with any language can be added but C++ is preferred.Kindly do not add copied code from some other source,This repository's sole purpose is to see different and optimal approaches. Time and space complexity if added is appreciated.Commented code is also advised.
#### Specific Algorithms and/or Data Structures:-
- Trees(Binary Trees,Binary Search Tress,n-ary Trees)
- graphs
- Dynammic Programming
- Greedy
- Divide and Conquor
- String Algorithms
- Tries
- Backtracking
- LinkedList
- Bitmasking
- Stack,queues and deques
- Heaps
